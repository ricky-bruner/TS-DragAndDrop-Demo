## Overview
This project is a practical implementation of the skills and concepts learned from the Udemy course "Understanding TypeScript" by Maximilian Schwarzmüller. It's a simple drag and drop application, showcasing the core features of TypeScript and its integration with modern web development tools.

## Features
- **Typescript Basics**: Demonstration of TypeScript types and their usage.
- **Compiler Configuration**: Insights into TypeScript compiler and custom configurations.
- **ES6 and TypeScript**: Implementation of ES6 features within a TypeScript context.
- **Advanced TypeScript Concepts**: Usage of classes, namespaces, modules, interfaces, generics, and decorators in TypeScript.
- **Project Setup with Webpack**: Configuration of a TypeScript project using webpack.

## Technologies Used
- TypeScript ^5.3.3
- webpack ^5.89.0 (with webpack-cli ^5.1.4, webpack-dev-server ^4.15.1)
- ts-loader ^9.5.1
- clean-webpack-plugin ^4.0.0

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine to use `npm` for managing dependencies.

```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ricky-bruner/TS-DragAndDrop-Demo.git
```
2. Install NPM packages:
```sh
    npm install
```

### Usage
To run the application in dev, you'll want to use the command below:
```sh
    npm start
```

### Configuration
Everything is currently configured for the versions installed, particularly typescript and webpack - so no other configurations should be needed.


### Acknowledgements
Maximilian Schwarzmüller and his course "Understanding TypeScript" - it is incredible, and a fantastic learning tool for TypeScript and more in depth, hands-on experience with SOLID principles and OOP paradigms.
